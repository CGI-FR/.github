## CGI & Open Source

There is a long story between the CGI and the Open Source community.

* We consume third-party open source software is used in the CGI technology stack. We are more committed to using open source software than ever before, and we already have an open source review board. It primarily ensures that when we use open source software, we carefully read the license, terms and conditions, and any specific legal issues (such as embargos ...).

* We contribute to third-party open source projects that are already in existence. These contributions have occurred previously, and we have a legal framework that we can use. It addresses the license under which we contribute, the legal entity contributing, the individual contributing, and intellectual property management. We'd like to encourage our teams to participate in open source projects: it's a way for CGI to give back to the OSS community after years of consuming the value it created.

* We create Open source proprietary software and its entire lifecycle, both internally and externally. CGI is now willing to create open source software, signaling a significant shift in this direction.

## Why is this important to CGI ?

Our adoption of open source software is a key part of our mission to build a trusted, secure, and stable environment for our customers and citizens. But this also a rationale for our decision to use open source software in our own projects.

We have long recognized that it is more cost-effective to use or customize existing open source software than to build our own solutions to compete with an already successful open source community. Furthermore, this economic equation exists for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software: in some cases, adopting open source software is competitive with commercial offers. Long term, leveraging existing software speeds up development, allows for collaborative development, and optimizes R&D.

By demonstrating how CGI develops cutting-edge solutions that address technical issues, we may deepen our understanding of those technologies, expand our technical competence, enhance CGI's reputation, and increase our influence in the community. Greater talent recruitment and retention follow from this.

Similarly, recruiting benefits from a pool of external talents who are already familiar with the open source software that is already part of our technology stack. Maintain the Open Source Community from which we benefited by contributing and giving back.
